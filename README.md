# Mental Health in Tech Analysis

## Motivation
The tech industry's demanding and competitive environment can have detrimental effects on mental health, resulting in heightened levels of stress and burnout. A 2019 BIMA report revealed that over half of tech workers have experienced mental health issues. It is crucial that this issue is not only acknowledged but also openly discussed by both employers and employees. 

## Dataset
The present analysis employs a dataset from a 2014 survey that gauges the prevalence of mental health disorders among employees and their perceptions of mental health in the workplace.<br/>
